Lagrange polynomial usually has big problems with precision, as you take more points.\
But you can't have precision problems, if you store numbers in fractions of two [BigInteger](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.numerics.biginteger)'s.\
Runge's phenomenon isn't going anywhere though...
